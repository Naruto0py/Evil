    <p>
        Billie convinces Jade to go to a party at Simon's house with her. Angel infiltrates New Raccoon City, tracks the pair down to the party, and warns they are in danger. They talk about the Raccoon City incident, believed to be the result of a gas leak or a fire. He insists it was a nuclear attack planned by the US government to cover it up. He reveals that, according to records, the two girls do not exist, while Albert should have been dead in 2009. His comments scare them, and they flee. When trying to catch up to them, Angel is detained by Umbrella security.

        The Brotherhood takes their new captives to a prison. Jade becomes intrigued by the 300 chained-up Zeroes in there, who coordinate as a workforce, moving a large rotating mechanism to power the prison. One of them, "Mother Zero", seems to be their leader. Baxter persuades Jade to help him escape. The two succeed and rally other captured USS troopers, who recover their weapons when the Zeroes are let lose. With a chainsaw, Jade decapitates the queen and is forced to lock herself in a room away from the Zeroes. The door flies open, crushing and setting off a bundle of hand grenades. The blast kills many of the Zeroes and leaves Jade in a weakened state. Baxter saves her, and the two make their way to a sewer hatch. While trying to climb up, Baxter gets killed by the Zeroes. Jade manages to get outside, only to be put under an Umbrella spotlight.

        Albert is picked-up and taken to Umbrella HQ to meet with Evelyn. He is introduced to a badly beaten Angel Rubio, and is ordered to interrogate him. Solving Wesker's riddles around the house, Jade finds a hidden bag containing $10,000 USD, fake passports to America and a gun. With Simon's help, the girls find a secret laboratory in the house and trigger an intruder alarm. The research data gets set on fire. Albert enters the room, angry and confused. He reveals the girls were born in the UCSF School of Medicine in San Francisco, using two women's eggs. The dog that bit Billie was infected with T-virus, which causes mutations; Billie appears to be resistant to the virus, as the girls were genetically modified to excel in mental and physical performances; Umbrella is aware of their origins, and will preserve Billie as a lab specimen if they find out she was infected.

        Albert renews the interrogation. During it, he secretly asks Angel if anyone else knows about Billie and Jade. Angel replies "no" and is injected with a drug that kills him. Evelyn cancels the interrogation while medical personnel see to Angel, accuses Albert of being Angel's mole and has him imprisoned. During Angelâ€™s autopsy the coroner's incision in his chest causes his body to begin convulsing. Albert notices someone else is in the next cell and through a hole in the wall, finds an exact double of himself with a beard.

        Jade is locked up in one of Umbrella's bases, and is interrogated by Billie, who is working for Evelyn. The two have not seen one another since around 2026 when Jade was pregnant, and Albert has since died. While Jade is aware that Umbrella is a threat to The University, Billie's search for Jade is more of a personal stake - although she is highly-resistant to the T-Virus she is not immune, and ultimately she will deteriorate. Billie gives her the position of a University search team and slices an Umbrella tracking chip from her arm so she can escape freely. Jade collects the severed head of Mother Zero and runs out. Out in the open, Jade heads towards the coast where she finds a boat. She is ambushed by the search team, consisting of Amrita and Gideon who take her to their ship, carrying Arjun and Bea. Following the coastline, the ship passes derelict craft, who's Zero occupants are submerged but still alive, twitching as the ship passes overhead. Jade waits in the lab for the Mother Zero autopsy, with Amrita taking part, who Jade correctly deduces is two months pregnant. The autopsy determines Mother Zero's body is producing two enzymes which degrade upon exposure to Oxygen. Over the night they go through 55 different tests to preserve the enzymes with artificial saliva, with Jade stabilizing Test 56 by spitting in the sample. They introduce T-virus to the enzymes, determining that one has an attractive property and the other a repelling property, meaning that in theory the enzymes could be used to both ward Zeroes away and to order them to attack a target. Jade puts the theory to the test and rides out in a boat to the coast to retrieve a Zero woman to study. Back in the lab Bea walks in, with Jade keeping her at the door. Jade cuts her finger to begin the test, expecting to trigger the Zero's sense of smell. Jade's enzyme treatment works in keeping her protected, but the Zero instead turns her attention to Bea, ripping her cuffs and chasing her down a corridor. Bea inadvertently lures the Zero to other people, and she bites Amrita, before being gunned down. Jade takes responsibility for the attack, and is almost killed by Amrita's partner Paolo.
