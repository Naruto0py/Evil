Jade and Billie are found by Albert who helps them flee before Umbrella's U.S.S. operators appear. At home, he tells the girls the dog was being treated for a "rare genetic disease". He makes them promise to never talk about it, as it is a classified "government" project. In the morning, Jade continues to investigate and finds a website claiming to have "The Truth". It discusses outbreaks at Umbrella's labs that cause infected employees to become cannibals. Angel Rubio, the website's admin, is an investigative reporter obsessed with Umbrella. Meanwhile, Bille vomits and starts to show signs of infection.

As a high priority asset, Baxter orders his men to focus on killing the Zeroes to protect her so she can be captured. Jade manages to escape and drives to Dover. Later while she is among some refugees, a ferry arrives, and the group are confronted by a U.S.S. convoy backed-up by an armed drone. The crowd is forced on the run with the drone killing them while Baxter looks on from his stationary vehicle.

    In the lab, Wesker determines that he has 52 hours to treat Billie's condition before murderous impulses take over her. In the morning, Billie gets up disoriented but pretends to be fine. At school, she becomes distressed and hypersensitive to sound. She also begins suffering from hallucinations. Jade and fellow student Simon talk about getting more notes from Angel after class, but a surprise update to Umbrella's firewall means that can no longer happen until he knows the code.

    Jade hides inside a warehouse with a boy, Liam, and his parents. They all take a refugee convoy. During the drive, they are forced to hide in their cars after hearing Lickers nearby. Baxter soon arrives alerting the Lickers who break into the convoy and start killing people. Only a few survivors escape, and, while travelling through flooded tunnels, they discover Liam is infected. His parents reveal he was bitten three days prior. Suddenly, a giant mutated spider starts attacking. During the ensuing fight, Liam’s father, Mark, dies and Jade kills the spider by lowering a shutter on it. She returns to Liam's mother and tries to encourage her to leave the boy, to no avail. Forced to continue her journey alone, Jade gets out of the service tunnel in Calais, France, and finds Baxter waiting for her. He is shot and wounded, while the surviving operators are detained by Brotherhood militants. Jade is mistaken for another Umbrella operator and is knocked out.
