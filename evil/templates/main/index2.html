<p>
    Albert "Al" Wesker, Albert "Bert" Wesker and Albert "Alby" Wesker are performing research at an Umbrella outpost. The three are clones of Albert Wesker, a superhuman who is their leader. They are soon confronted by USS operators who attempt to detain them for their unauthorized use of Umbrella assets. Albert is quick to deal with them using his enhanced abilities, but when more soldiers arrive he changes tactics and decides to kill the clones to prevent them being used; the USS reinforcements arrive faster than anticipated, and he is only able to kill Alby before leaving, with Al and Bert being captured as Umbrella CEO Evelyn Marcus makes her way into the lab.

    Al and Bert talk through the wall, having not seen one another in seventeen years. Evelyn interrogates Al, revealing the coroner's verdict Angel was poisoned with three times the lethal dose of Umbrella's new product Joy and confirming her suspicions he sabotaged the interrogation. In the cells, Bert kills 2 Umbrella guards and escapes. At school, Billie and Jade talk with Simon, but are interrupted by Bert who has come to pick them up in a stolen car, pounding on the horn to identify who they are. He bluffs his way through questioning about Angel and offers to take them out for food. They are put off by his unusual behavior and erratic driving. Bert Finally reveals he and Al are clones and part of an R&D team, but this only convinces the two girls to avoid him. At this point the Umbrella team tracks them down, and Bert uses his fighting prowess to kill three guards, with Roth succeeding in restraining him. The girls are ordered to come with them. Billie and Jade are brought up to the interrogation room, where Al is lying on the floor in pain. Blood samples are taken from the two girls, with Evelyn reveals the truth about their origins - the two girls were created as part of a treatment for Al's condition, with themselves effectively being a permanent source of viable blood for transfusions. When offered a blood sample, Al hesitantly injects himself to recover. Billie and Jade are allowed to leave.

    Jade continues her study of the Mother Zero's head, and discovers an Umbrella tracking device embedded within her head, indicating she was a person of interest when captured by The Brotherhood and that Jade is responsible for Umbrella finding the ship. Arjun interrupts her warning that the crew has agreed to hear out a truce with Saquim to go ashore and meet with Evelyn Marcus. He is taken to a tent at a temporary base, where he is introduced to Evelyn. She tells him she wants Jade handed over. When Bea comes to visit, Jade warns her to get Arjun and a green duffel bag and leave the ship. Soon, her fellow University members return with the results of their dealings with Evelyn and prepare to surrender her. On the shore, Jade is directed by a senior USS commander, Molloy, to their base. There she finds Evelyn, who begins singing and dancing in what is revealed to be Billie using the modified Joy to manipulate her and, unofficially, Billie has been in control of Umbrella for years. She reveals her goals very clearly - she wants Jade kept with her and who will be a source of blood to stabilize her condition. Realizing she cannot stop the order, Jade releases a vial containing the attractor enzyme; hundreds of Zeroes begin flocking to the base, killing any USS operators in their way. The ship goes on alert at the sight of so many Zeroes and disembarks, revealing that the ship has had a massive infected crocodile in tow. The Zeroes manage to easily break through the base's perimeter wall and rush towards Billie and Jade, the two reach out and hold hands.

     Bert is brought back to his cell by Evelyn; she tries to keep him working for her by offering the opportunity of a house of his own if he assists her with a new project - the Tyrant. Jade and Billie make a break for it but are caught by Roth, the two resort to fighting, with Billie using her enhanced strength on him and reinforcements. Ready to escape with Billie, Simon and Jade infiltrate Umbrella HQ. Upstairs, Billie regains control of herself and fights back the labtech, stabbing him in the eye with the syringe and slashing Evelyn. Billie's hallucinations take hold once more and she is attacked by a dog which disappears when Bert snaps her out of it and asks about Al. When he learns of Billie's origins, he sympathises with her, having been created as a tool as well, but urges her to accept her life and see the best in people. Umbrella HQ's security system has kicked in in response to Billie's escape attempt, and Roth now leads a USS team hunting her with orders to kill. Evelyn joins the group as they expand their search. Billie starts hallucinating again and believes she is under attack which makes her bite Simon, infecting him with T-virus. Simon abandons their group effort and surrenders himself to Evelyn, who executes him rather than hear out Al and Bert's offer of finding a treatment. The two Wesker men kill several operators and drag Billie and Jade out of the building. The four flee through the parking lot. Al and Bert begin soaking the lab with chemicals to make a bomb. Al asks Bert to go with the girls while he sets it off, telling Bert he deserves a life of his own. He tears of a piece of paper and writes a contact for Jade (latter revealed to be Ada Wong). As the three leave, Al is confronted by Evelyn who defends the murder of her own son as a necessity and Al's fault. She shoots him twice, leading him to fall down and set the lighter on. The lab catches fire, and Evelyn narrowly makes it to safety as the whole building goes up in flames. The escaped Tyrant is seen breaking through the rubble of the lab.

    A large group of Zeroes continue to make their way through Umbrella's perimeter. Billie returns to the tent where Evelyn is, while Jade is dragged out by two operators towards the Zeroes and fights back. Billie activates Umbrella's drones, which begin to wipe out the Zeroes as Jade escapes. Still covered in the deterrent enzyme, the Zeroes ignore her as she heads to the ship, with Arjun throwing a rope for her to climb aboard. To protect themselves should Umbrella succeed, Saqim orders the release of a large mutant crocodile as emergency protection. Billie's drones succeed in wiping out the Zeroes, with the expense of all remaining USS operators who are killed in the cross-fire. Soon, the crocodile makes its way onto land. Back on the ship, Jade realises that Bea is missing and has come to shore on a stolen boat. Billie manages to escape on a helicopter, using its rockets to kill the crocodile. Jade is confronted by Billie and the helicopter crew, who wish to take Bea back as a specimen. Jade is unable to shoot her sister, and offers a surrender in exchange for her daughter Bea's freedom. Billie instead shoots Jade, deeming her an irrelevance if she has Bea. Jade gets back up right as the helicopter flies over.
